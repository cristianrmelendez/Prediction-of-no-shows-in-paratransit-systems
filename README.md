# Prediction-of-no-shows-in-paratransit-systems
The objective of this research project is threefold: (i) to develop a classification
methodology to predict no-shows and cancellations of trips in paratransit systems, (ii) to
incorporate the classification model predictions into trip booking and routing models for
paratransit operations (including novel overbooking problems in the context of paratransit), and
(iii) to evaluate the value of the classification modelsâ€™ predictions in paratransit planning and
operations.
